This program is pretty simple to run. It only has working features for a triangle, circle, square and rectangle. I've added a feature that 
reads in the list of shapes from a txt file line by line and if the user tries to add a shape not in the list/not currently programmed it will add it to the text file.

This program is just a quick refresher I made in an hour to refresh my python literacy and basic knowledge.
